For this summary I read the paper called ``Relation Extraction with Matrix
Factorization and Universal Schemas'' by Riedel et
al~\cite{DBLP:conf/naacl/RiedelYMM13}.

\section{Content Summary}

The \textbf{motivation} is the produce an ``universal'' narrative schema
database.

The paper \textbf{contributes} a generated narrative schema database.

There has been a lot of \textbf{related work} in creating narrative schema
databases, but those have required a lot of labeled data to create.

\textbf{Support} for their results is given through good results in predicting
new narrative relationships.


\section{Analysis}

I think the \textbf{writing} in this paper is very good. It's easy to
understand but still conveys their results well.

The \textbf{motivation} for the paper is also good; Narrative schemas are good,
but creating them manually is painful.

The team's \textbf{contributions} are good.

\textbf{Evaluating} their contributions, their results are good, and their
conclusions sensible.

The paper suggest \textbf{future work} in using their method to combine
existing schemas.
